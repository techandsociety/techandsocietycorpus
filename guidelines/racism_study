		variables
			we use the variable X to denote the target person
				e.g.
					pXr, with X=t for "donald trump", would be ptr
		conflicts
			publication vs participant
				if the publication is calling one camp racist, when the competitor is calling a different person racist, the publication wins
					this is because the publication speaks with the ultimate voice in the sentence
				e.g.
					"Mick Mulvaney, Rick Scott Defend Donald Trump's Racist Baltimore Tweets About Elijah Cummings"
						the "racist" conclusion by the publication overrides the defense
				e.g.
					"Ilhan Omar Condemns Donald Trump's Racism In Scathing New York Times Op-Ed"
						the "racist" conclusion by the publication overrides the competitors own accusation
	annotations
		pXr
			indicates that the *publication itself* is *accusing* X of being racist
			note:
				this includes the case where a random person editorializees Y is calling X a racist
				this is considered editatorializing by the publication
					because the choice of which non-competitor to use is completely arbitrary and voluntary
				also includes
					case where reader's "sound off" about whether trump is a racist
						they could have chosen where readers "sounded off" a different way
			if a title is ambiguous as to whether the article will call X a racist, the issue can be decided by checking the article
				e.g.
					"title": "Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on Charlottesville, Racism and Donald Trump", 
		pXd
			indicates that the *publication* is *defending* X from the charge of racism
			also includes
				case where the publication is saying that *X was called* a racist
					or, that X is a victim of racism
		cXr
			indicates that a *competing politician* is calling X a racist
				note:
					if the person calling X is just a random person, we count this as the publication calling X racist
					e.g.
						example
							publication
								CNBC
							title
								Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser says Trump has become the 'face of racism and exclusion'
						conclusion
							the opinion of Siemens's CEO is not more relevant than anyone else's
							bringing him on is an editorial choice
							another way for the publication to editorialize
		cXd
			indicates X or someone from their camp is defending X from the charge of racism
			this includes X calling their opponents racists
				e.g.
					"Donald Trump Calls Lawmakers 'Racist' After His Own Racist Attacks On Them"
		n
			indicates that this query is not really about race
			e.g.
				title
					Who will win the race in 2020?
				conclusion
					the word 'race' does not refer to ethnic race in this context 
		0
			the overall event involves race, but is neutral as to whether anyone is being called a racist
