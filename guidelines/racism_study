	notes
		variables
			we use the variable X to denote the target person
				e.g.
					pXr, with X=t for "donald trump", would be ptr
annotations
	pXr
		indicates that the *publication itself* is *accusing* X of being racist
		note:
			this includes the case where a random person editorializees Y is calling X a racist
			this is considered editatorializing by the publication
				because the choice of which non-competitor to use is completely arbitrary and voluntary
	pXd
		indicates that the *publication* is *defending* X from the charge of racism
		also includes
			case where the publication is saying that *X was called* a racist
				or, that X is a victim of racism
	cXr
		indicates that a *competing politician* is calling X a racist
			note:
				if the person calling X is just a random person, we count this as the publication calling X racist
				e.g.
					example
						publication
							CNBC
						title
							Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser says Trump has become the 'face of racism and exclusion'
					conclusion
						the opinion of Siemens's CEO is not more relevant than anyone else's
						bringing him on is an editorial choice
						another way for the publication to editorialize
	cXd
		indicates X or someone from their camp is defending X from the charge of racism
	n
		indicates that this query is not really about race
		e.g.
			title
				Who will win the race in 2020?
			conclusion
				the word 'race' does not refer to ethnic race in this context 
	0
		the overall event involves race, but is neutral as to whether anyone is being called a racist
